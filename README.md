# FT-81x-Digirig-Adapter
Low profile adapter for FT-81x based on design by [BG6LH](https://github.com/BG6LH)

I bought the Digirig mobile and had to interface it with my Yaesu FT817 but neither want to buy the expensively priced cables nor like that it protrudes out the rear. I was unable to find any right angle mini-DIN but luckily i came across BG8LH's [FT-81x Bluetooth digirig adapter](https://github.com/BG6LH/FT-81x-BT-DIGI-Adaptor). I downloaded his github and proceed to mod it, ripping up everything but the mini-DINs and then added 2x 3.5mm TRRS jacks.
